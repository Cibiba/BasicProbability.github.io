            <h3 id="leerdoel">Intended Learning Outcomes</h3>

            <p>This course is designed to provide students with the background in discrete probability theory and
                programming that is necessary to follow other more advanced master-level courses in areas such as
                linguistics, natural language processing, machine learning, complexity theory, cryptography, information
                theory, quantum computing, combinatorics, etc. The goal is to make students that have had no prior
                exposure to probability theory and/or programming feel comfortable in these areas. To achieve this goal
                we will try to illustrate the theoretical concepts with real-life examples that relate to topics in,
                e.g., computer science, gambling, and the like. Moreover, we will make sure that there is a close tie
                between the theoretical and practical part of the course, thus enabling students to apply their newly
                acquired theoretical knowledge to real problems.</p>

            <p>The course is designed to equip the students with an understanding of probability theory and programming
                skills that will be necessary for more advanced courses. At the end of the course, students will be able
                to:</p>

            <p>Theory:</p>
            <ul class="bullets-outside">
                <li>apply basic combinatorics in simple scenarios,</li>
                <li>do calculations with discrete probabilities,</li>
                <li>understand and use the main results in basic probability theory,</li>
                <li>use random variables to group outcomes in a way that is adequate for solving probabilistic
                    problems,
                </li>
                <li>formulate generative probability models and derive under independence assumptions the model
                    parameters,
                </li>
                <li>build simple probabilistic models to explain real-world data,</li>
                <li>use simple estimation techniques to infer the parameters of distributions from data</li>
                <li>understand and use concepts in Information Theory like entropy and perplexity as means for
                    quantifying uncertainty in predicting data relative to a given model,
                </li>
                <li>get acquainted with the principles of empirical research including goals and methods of
                    experimentation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Programming:</p>
            <ul class="bullets-outside">
                <li>use an IDE to structure their programs in understandable hierarchies,</li>
                <li>use the Python programming language,</li>
                <li>use certain Python libraries designed specifically for mathematical operations (e.g., numpy),</li>
                <li>implement some of the concepts acquired in the theory part of the course.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="schedule">Content Schedule</h3>

            <p>The course will largely focus on discrete probability theory. It will roughly follow this structure (with
                the possibility that the contents of certain weeks may be exchanged). Depending on the progress of the
                course, we may choose to only cover the topics from weeks 1 to 6 and spread them out more:</p>

            <h3 id="aanbevolenVoorkennis">Prerequisites</h3>

            <p>We pre-suppose very basic prior exposure to set theory (essentially at the level of basic set operations
                like union, intersection and set difference). Other than that, the course will be entirely
                self-contained. In particular, no prior programming knowledge is required. We expect a high level of
                interest and engagement from the students.</p>

            <h3 id="onderwijsvorm">Course Design</h3>

            <p>This course has a theoretical and a practical component, both of which are of equal importance. The
                course will consist of lectures and programming labs. The goal is to work interactively with the
                students. We therefore expect a high level of engagement from the students. In order to involve the
                students, the lectures will be interspersed with small in-class exercises.</p>

            <h3 id="material">Material</h3>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/BasicProbability/LectureNotes/blob/master/fullscript/BasicProbabilityAndStatistics.pdf">A lecture script</a> that is closely aligned 
		with the content of the lectures will be provided. The code
                produced during the programming labs will be cleaned, commented out, and be made available online. In
                addition, students may use <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/" target="_blank">Think Python</a>, which is freely available online, as a reference.</p>

	    <p>All material for this course is provided on the <a href="https://github.com/BasicProbability/">github.com</a> platform. This platform is commonly used for open-source software development and 
	    you are encouraged to get familiar with it. In particular, you are encouraged to <b>help us</b> with improving the lecture notes and websites. You can earn up to one extra point per week (for your weekly programming assignment) by
	    getting a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">pull request</a> accepted by us. In order to do that, you will have to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/">get yourself (for free) an account on github</a>, 
	    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">fork</a> one of <a href="https://github.com/BasicProbability/BasicProbability.github.io">our</a> <a href="https://github.com/BasicProbability/LectureNotes">repositories</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository">clone</a> the fork onto your machine, correct the typo or error you have found, <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit">commit</a> it to your fork, and submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">pull request</a>.
	    Once we have checked and accepted your changes, you will get the extra point.</p>

            <p>30</p>

            <h3 id="toetsvorm">Examination</h3>

            <p>There will be weekly theoretical and programming homework which will be weighed equally. In addition,
                there may be a small final programming project. While the theoretical homework will be graded by the
                lecturers, the programming homework will be graded through peer assessment.</p>
            <p><b>Cooperation among students for both theory and programming exercises is strongly encouraged.</b> However, after this discussion phase, every student writes down and submits his/her own individual solution.</p>
